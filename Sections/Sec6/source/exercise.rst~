      N <- 1

4. 1
   a. :math:`X` follows a uniform distribution on :math:`[0, 1]`.
   b. A die is unbiased.
   c. :math:`X` follows a normal distribution with mean :math:`0` and variance :math:`\sigma^2>10`.
   d. :math:`X` follows a normal distribution with :math:`\mu = 0`.
   
   a. simple
   b. simple
   c. composite
   d. composite

2. (Section 9.11 Problem 3) Suppose that :math:`X\sim bin(100, p)`. Consider the test
   that reject :math:`H_0:p=.5` in favor of :math:`H_A: p\neq .5` for :math:`|X-50|>10`.
   Use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution to answer the following:
   
   a. What is :math:`\alpha`?
   b. Graph the power as a function of :math:`p`.

3. Let :math:`X` have one of the following distributions:

   :math:`x_2`  .3           .4
   :math:`x_3`  .3           .1
   :math:`x_4`  .2           .4
