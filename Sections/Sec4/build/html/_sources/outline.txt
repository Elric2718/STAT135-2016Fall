- Announcements:
HW1, HW2 and HW3 are returned in sections. You can also come to my OH to pick it up.

- R Lab:
In today's sections, you'll be shown how bootstrap works on some concrete examples. There
are four problems supposed to be solved on your own. I'll walk you through some of them.
After the sections, the slides will be posted on bcourse. It's good for you to look into
all the problems as well as the answers carefully.

- Homework Discussion:
Time permitting, I'll answer your questions about the homework after finishing the section
materials.
